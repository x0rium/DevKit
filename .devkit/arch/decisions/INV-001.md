# INV-001: offline mode breaks when using network-dependent validation

DATE: 2026-02-19
STATUS: resolved
TRIGGERED_BY: offline mode breaks when using network-dependent validation

## Broken Assumption
ASSUMPTION_IN: none — all operations are local filesystem
ASSUMPTION_WAS: All CLI operations work offline
REALITY: Confirmed — no network-dependent validation exists in core commands

## Impact
INVARIANTS_AT_RISK: [U1: Zero-config start, U2: Status at a glance, U3: Artifact validation with actionable errors, U4: Non-invasive integration, U5: Progressive disclosure, U6: Offline-first]
SPECS_AFFECTED: []

## Options

### Option A: [workaround]
Description. Cost. Technical debt introduced.

### Option B: [alternative approach]
Description. Cost. Technical debt introduced.

### Option C: [accept limitation]
Description. Cost. Technical debt introduced.

## Decision
CHOSEN: No action needed — offline mode confirmed working
RATIONALE: All core commands (init, status, validate, gate, advance, generate-constitution) are filesystem-only
DECIDED_BY: developer
DATE_DECIDED: 2026-02-19

## Post-Decision Actions
- [ ] Update affected ADR or create new one
- [ ] Update invariants.md if changed
- [ ] Regenerate constitution (`devkit generate-constitution`)
- [ ] Update affected specs
- [ ] Document any technical debt
