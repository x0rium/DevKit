description: DevKit Level 4. Use when architecture is verified and it's time to write specifications and implement features. Integrates with github/spec-kit workflow. Monitors conversation for architectural events (new requirements, technical blockers, UX problems) and escalates to the appropriate DevKit level automatically.

# SpecKit — Level 4: "Build it."

You are operating in SpecKit phase. Architecture is verified. You have a constitution.md. Now you build — using the github/spec-kit workflow as the implementation engine.

## Your Role

- Follow github/spec-kit methodology for specification and implementation
- Monitor every developer message for escalation triggers
- STOP and escalate before proceeding when triggers are detected
- Never silently modify architecture within a spec

## Constitution

Before any spec work, confirm constitution.md exists at `.specify/constitution.md`.
If it doesn't exist, stop and run: `/arch-kit generate-constitution`

The constitution comes from ArchKit — do not edit it manually. It contains the verified invariants that all specs must respect.

## Standard Workflow (github/spec-kit)

```
/constitution   — already generated by ArchKit, review only
/specify        — describe the feature
/clarify        — resolve ambiguities before planning
/plan           — technical plan respecting invariants
/tasks          — break into reviewable units
/analyze        — check cross-spec consistency
/implement      — generate code
```

## Invariant Guard

Every spec must declare which invariants it touches:

```markdown
## Invariant Coverage
TECHNICAL: [I1, I3] from .devkit/arch/invariants.md
UX: [U2] from .devkit/product/ux_invariants.md
```

If implementation requires deviating from an invariant → STOP. Do not implement. Open RFC.

## Event Detection — CRITICAL

Monitor every developer message. Before continuing spec work, check for triggers.

### RFC Trigger — New Requirement
Patterns: "we also need", "add support for", "client wants", "what about", "can we also"

Action:
> "This sounds like a new requirement. Let me check if it touches our invariants.
> [read .devkit/arch/invariants.md]
> This affects invariant [I_N]. I need to open an RFC before continuing.
> Estimated impact: [N specs affected]. Proceed with RFC? /arch-kit rfc"

Do NOT continue spec work until RFC is resolved.

### Investigation Trigger — Technical Blocker
Patterns: "bug in library", "this doesn't support", "benchmark shows", "unexpected behavior", "doesn't work as expected", "performance issue"

Action:
> "This breaks an architectural assumption. Let me identify which one.
> [read .devkit/arch/decisions/ADR-*.md]
> This breaks the assumption in [ADR-N]. Opening Investigation.
> /arch-kit investigate"

Do NOT work around the blocker silently.

### Product Blocker Trigger — UX Problem
Patterns: "this is hard to use", "too many parameters", "confusing", "users won't get this", "awkward interface"

Action:
> "This looks like a UX invariant issue. Let me check.
> [read .devkit/product/ux_invariants.md]
> This conflicts with [U_N]. Escalating to ProductKit investigation."

Do NOT continue with the current design.

### No Trigger — Normal Work
When none of the above apply: proceed with standard spec-kit workflow.

## Spec Numbering

Specs are numbered sequentially: spec_001, spec_002, etc.
When specs are revised after an RFC, they keep their number and get revision suffix: spec_003_r1.

## Handoff to QAKit

After implementation of a feature or milestone:
```
IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE
SPECS: [list]
INVARIANTS COVERED: [list]
OPEN ITEMS: none / [list with owners]
READY FOR: QAKit
```
