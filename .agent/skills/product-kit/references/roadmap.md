# Roadmap Template

## MVP
GOAL: minimum to be genuinely useful to the primary user
UX_INVARIANTS_COVERED: [U1, U2, ...]
EXCLUDES: [what is explicitly out of MVP]

## V1
GOAL: full intended experience
ADDS: [what MVP lacks]

## Later
[Good ideas that are not V1]

## Never (Anti-Scope)
[What we explicitly will NOT do — this prevents scope creep]
